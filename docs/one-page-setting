# The Golden Age and Its Fall

The discovery of faster-than-light travel and, subsequently, safe cryogenic technology, catapulted mankind into a golden age of exploration across the stars. However, a catastrophe many centuries ago left humanity isolated and scattered amongst the stars. Contact with EarthGov was lost, and now, corporations vie with each other for ownership of what advanced industry remains.

## The Stagnation

Centuries later, technological progress has stagnated. Substantial IP protection systems limit reparability and push stations, ships, and crews to their limits. Desperate for more economic inputs, the megacorps push ever outwards towards the rim of space. But control eludes them. Water piracy is rampant, entire stations are taken over by criminal syndicates, unions and sovereign colonies chafe under the corporate yoke, and many ships are simply never seen again.

### The State of Space

- **Mega Corporations** control corespace and much of rimspace.
- Between corporate entities, contracts and promises reign supreme.
- Pockets of ‘free’ space exist but are mostly lawless, denoted **X-Class space**. The most infamous of these is the **X-Class Station Prospero’s Dream**.
- The horrors of space encroach upon humanity and are only matched by the man-made horrors of the megacorps.

## The Deep and Its Secrets

You’ve heard reports of groups of scavengers, known as **"divers"**, uncovering unusual artifacts within the abandoned **CLOUDBANK synthetic production facility**, commonly referred to as **"The Deep."** These discoveries have drawn the attention of art dealers, syndicates, and tech companies, who are eager to offer generous rewards.

## Your Story

You are broke and hungry freelancers, hitchhikers, pioneers, and mercenaries on the outer rim of settled space. You are currently aboard the **X-Class Station 'Prospero’s Dream'**; a massive station with a population of over 8 million. It’s haphazard, disorganized, overcrowded, and teeming with hustlers and criminals of all stripes. 

You are currently contracted with **HazMOS Corporation** (Hazardous Mission Operational Specialists) as a member of a quick response team called **‘Lamplighters’**. Mega Corps and high-net-worth individuals often find themselves dealing with disasters. HazMOS dispatches teams of Lamplighters to preserve company investments and personnel.
